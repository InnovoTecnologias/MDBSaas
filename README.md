# MDB Saas Template in ASP.NET MVC

Integrating MDBootstrap in ASP.NET MVC

Here you will find a working project to take as starting point.

Note that it includes a conditional attribute in "header" in order not to show the full height when the Carousel is not rendered (indicated by ViewBag.RenderCarousel).

It includes Pricing, About and Contact Pages.

Thanks to the MDBootstrap Team.
